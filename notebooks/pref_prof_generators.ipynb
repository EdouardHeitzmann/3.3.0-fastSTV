    "Observe the multiplicity of candidates, as well as the fact that no voter in the `R` bloc cast a vote for `Q` candidates. To make the `Ballot` object as flexible as possible over different methods of election, we have implemented cumulative voting ballots as follows. The ranking on the ballot holds no meaning; all that matters is the multiplicity. That is, the ballot (R1, R1, R2) is the same as (R2, R1, R1). The `PreferenceProfile` object does not know that and thus displays them as different ballots, but our cumulative election class will handle tallying results for you."
