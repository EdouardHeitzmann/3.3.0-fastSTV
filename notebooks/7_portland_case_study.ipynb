    "In November 2022, voters in Portland, Oregon approved an overhaul to their system of election.\n",
    "Previously, Portland had a commission model, with four councillors elected at-large, plus the mayor\n",
    "as a member of the council. In that system, candidates ran for numbered seats—for instance \"City\n",
    "Commissioner Position 4\"—for which the whole city voted. The new system holds the mayor separate and expands to 12 seats, with four geographical districts electing three councillors each through ranked-choice voting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The precise system of election now in place is called STV or \"single transferable vote\"; support\n",
    "from roughly a quarter of the district’s voters is the threshold required for election. Voters can rank\n",
    "up to six candidates, and rounds of tabulation are conducted with support transferring down the\n",
    "ballot until three candidates cross the threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data and Democracy Lab released a report studying the election, in particular the mechanics of the STV election to explain that the voting system played a direct role in securing such strong representation for communities of color. You can read the report [here.](https://mggg.org/ppm)\n",
    "In this tutorial notebook, we show how VoteKit can be used to replicate the analysis done in the report. For a more thorough replication repository, you can visit [this GitHub repo.](https://github.com/mggg/Portland-Postmortem)"

    "The city of Portland released the cast vote record (CVR) for the election in a format that reflected the scantron style ballot. Each voter was given a row in a table, and each candidate was given 6 columns, one for each ranking position. A vote for a candidate in position i was recorded as a 1 in that candidate's \"Ranking i\" column, and 0 otherwise. This allows for the possiblity of overvotes---multiple candidates can have a 1 in their \"Ranking i\" column--- and skips---no candidate has a 1 in their \"Ranking i\" column. In order to make this format readable by VoteKit, we need to transform it so that there are only 6 columns total. Each column represents one position of a ranking, and the entry of that column is the candidate ranked in that position. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this format, the city also released the data by district, but included every voter from the entire city in each data set. So we will have to scrub the voters that are from the other 3 districts.\n",
