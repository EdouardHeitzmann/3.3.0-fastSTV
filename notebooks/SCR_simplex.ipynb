    "Informally, the candidate simplex is a geometric representation of the space of preference intervals. \n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, let $n$ denote the number of candidates. The candidate simplex is the simplex generated by the convex hull of the vectors $e_i = (0,\\dots,0,1,0,\\dots,0)$ for $1\\le i\\le n$. Each point on the simplex is then represented by $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i e_i$, where $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i = 1$ and $\\lambda_i\\ge 0$ for $1\\le i\\le n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be easiest to visualize with three candidates; let's call them $A,B,C$. Then we have the vectors $e_1 = (1,0,0), e_2 = (0,1,0), e_3 = (0,0,1)$. Our candidate simplex is a triangle, with each vertex representing one of the candidates. Each point on the triangle is a vector $(a,b,c)$ where $a+b+c=1$ and $a,b,c\\ge 0$. The value of $a$ denotes someone's \"preference\" for $A$. Thus, a point in the candidate simplex is precisely a preference interval for the candidates!"

    "\n",
    "In what follows, we will presume we are discussing the candidate simplex, but it all applies to the ballot simplex as well. The Dirichlet distribution is a probability distribution on the simplex. We parameterize it with a value $\\alpha \\in (0,\\infty)$. When $\\alpha=1$, the Dirichlet distribution is uniform on the simplex. That is, we have an equal chance of selecting any preference interval. As $\\alpha\\to \\infty$, the mass of the distribution moves to the center of the simplex. This means we are more likely to sample preference intervals that have equal support for all candidates. As $\\alpha\\to 0$, the mass moves to the vertices. This means we are more likely to sample preference intervals that have strong support for one candidate.\n",

    "The value $\\alpha$ is never allowed to be 0 or $\\infty$, so VoteKit uses an arbitrary large number ($10^{20}$) and an arbitrary small number $(10^{-10})$. When members of MGGG have done experiments for studies, they have taken $\\alpha = 1/2$ to be small and $\\alpha = 2$ to be big."
