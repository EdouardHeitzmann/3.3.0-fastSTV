    "Elections are the systems or algorithms by which a `PreferenceProfile`, or collection of ballots, is converted into an outcome. There are infinitely many different possible election methods, whether the output is a single winner, a set of winners, or a consensus ranking. VoteKit has a host of built-in election methods, as well as the functionality to let you create your own system of election. By the end of this section, you will have been introduced to the STV and Borda elections, learned about the `Election` object, and created your own election type."

As a reminder, this election had 35 named candidates running for one seat, and used an IRV election system (which is mathematically equivalent to a single-winner STV election) to choose the winner. Voters were only allowed to rank their top three candidates.\n",

    "First, what is this showing?  Generally, the winners are listed in the order they were elected, from the top down.  Eliminated candidates are filled in in the order they were eliminated, bottom-up.  If any candidates are still remaining without having been designated elected or eliminated, they are in a middle category called `Remaining`.  Ties are broken by strength, meaning for instance that if 3 candidates are remaining at the end, they are listed in the order of their first-place in the final election state.  This means that this output can be thought of as an aggregate ranking vector produced by applying the election method to the voters' ranking vectors.  "

    "So what exactly is happening in this STV election? STV stands for \"single transferable vote.\" Voters cast ranked choice ballots. A threshold is set of how much support is required for election; if a candidate crosses the threshold, they are designated as a winner. The threshold in VoteKit defaults to something called the **Droop quota**. If there are $N$ voters and $m$ seats, then Droop quota is computed as $T=\\lfloor N/(m+1)\\rfloor +1$. Another option is the **Hare quota**, which is just $T=N/m$, which is a little bit larger. Generally, all that is needed of a threshold is that it can't be the case that $m+1$ candidates exceed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first round, the first-place votes for each candidate are tallied. If candidate $A$ crosses the threshold, they are elected. If there were surplus votes, then the ballots with $A$ in first place are transfered, with appropriately reduced weight, to the next choice of those voters. If another candidate receives enough transfered support to cross the threshold, they are elected. If no candidate does, the candidate with the fewest first-place votes is removed from all ballots, and their votes are transfered with full weight. This repeats until all seats are filled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work out a small example where it is easier to see how STV works. We will use a fractional transfer rule. If the threshold is $T$ and a candidate received $rT$ votes in a given round, where $r>1$, then the excess is $(r-1)T$ and so ballots are now \"discounted\" to have new weight $(r-1)/r$. For instance if the candidate received 150 votes but only needed 100, there would be 50 \"excess\" votes.  Instead of randomly picking 50 out of 150 ballots to transfer, we transfer them all with a reduced weight of 50/150, or 1/3.  Here is a [link](https://mggg.org/publications/political-geometry/20-WeighillDuchin.pdf) to a more substantial explainer about ranked choice.\n",

    "There are many different possible election methods, both for choosing a single seat or multiple seats. `VoteKit` has a host of built-in election methods, as well as the functionality to let you create your own kind of election. You have been introduced to the STV and Borda elections and learned about the `Election` object. This should allow you to model any kind of elections you see in the real world, including rules that have not yet been implemented in `VoteKit`."

    "\n",
    "`VoteKit` can't be comprehensive in terms of possible election rules. However, with the `Election` and `ElectionState` classes, you can create your own. Let's create a bit of a silly example; to elect $m$ seats, at each stage of the election we randomly choose one candidate to elect. Most of the methods are handled by the `RankingElection` class, so we really only need to define how a step works, and how to know when it's over."
