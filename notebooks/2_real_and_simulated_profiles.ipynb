    "'undervote', 'overvote', and 'UWI'. This cast vote record was already cleaned by the City of Minneapolis, and they chose this way of parsing the ballots:  'undervote' indicates that the voter left a position unfilled, such as by having no candidate listed in second place. The 'overvote' notation arises when a voter puts two candidates in one position, like by putting Hodges and Samuels both in first place.  Unfortunately this way of storing the profile means we have lost any knowledge of the voter intent (which was probably to indicate equal preference). 'UWI' stands for unregistered write-in.\n",

For now, let's assume that we want to further condense the ballots, discarding 'undervote', 'overvote', and 'UWI' as candidates. The function `remove_noncands` will do this for us once we specify which (non)candidates to remove. If a ballot was \"A B undervote\", it will become \"A B\". If a ballot was \"A UWI B\" it will now be \"A B\" as well. Many other cleaning options are reasonable."

    "## Generating Preference Intervals from Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have seen a few ballot generators, we can introduce the candidate simplex and the Dirichlet distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that you can initialize the Plackett-Luce model and the Bradley-Terry model from a preference interval (or multiple ones if you have different voting blocs). Recall, a preference interval stores a voter's preference for candidates as a vector of non-negative values that sum to 1. Other models that rely on preference intervals include the Alternating Crossover model (AC) and the Cambridge Sampler (CS). There is a nice geometric representation of preference intervals via the candidate simplex.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Candidate Simplex\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally, the candidate simplex is a geometric representation of the space of preference intervals. With two candidates, it is an interval; with three candidates, it is a triangle; with four, a tetrahedron; and so on getting harder to visualize as the dimension goes up.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be easiest to visualize with three candidates $A,B,C$. Then there is a one-to-one correspondence between positions in the triangle and what are called **convex combinations** of the extreme points.  For instance, $.8A+.15B+.05C$ is a weighted average of those points giving 80% of the weight to $A$, 15% to $B$, and 5% to $C$.  The result is a point that is closest to $A$, as seen in the picture.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Those coefficients, which sum to 1, become the lengths of the candidate's sub-intervals.  So this lets us see the simplex as the space of all preference intervals.\n",

    "### Dirichlet Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dirichlet distributions** are a one-parameter family of probability distributions on the simplex---this is used here to choose a preference interval at random. We parameterize it with a value $\\alpha \\in (0,\\infty)$. As $\\alpha\\to \\infty$, the support of the distribution moves to the center of the simplex. This means we are more likely to sample preference intervals that have roughly equal support for all candidates, which will translate to all orderings being equally likely. As $\\alpha\\to 0$, the mass moves to the vertices. This means we are more likely to choose a preference interval that has strong support for a single candidate.  In between is $\\alpha=1$, where any region of the simplex is weighted in proportion to its area.  We think of this as the \"all bets are off\" setting -- you might choose a balanced preference, a concentrated preference, or something in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value $\\alpha$ is never allowed to equal 0 or $\\infty$ in Python, so VoteKit changes these to a very small number ($10^{-10}$) and a very large number $(10^{20})$.  We don't recommend using values that extreme. In previous studies, MGGG members have taken $\\alpha = 1/2$ to be \"small\" and $\\alpha = 2$ to be \"big.\"\n",
