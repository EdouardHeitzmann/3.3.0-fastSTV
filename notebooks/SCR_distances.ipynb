    "The Earthmover distance is a measure of how far apart two distributions are over a given metric space. In our case, the metric space is the `BallotGraph` endowed with the shortes path metric. We then consider a `PreferenceProfile` to be a distribution that assigns the number of times a ballot was cast to a node of the `BallotGraph`. Informally, the Earthmover distance is the minimum cost of moving the \"dirt\" piled on the nodes by the first profile to the second profile given the distance it must travel."
